Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It’s written in what people like to call “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ).

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.

Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text—stuff like making things bold, creating headers, and organizing lists.

If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown!

In each lesson, you’ll be given an introduction to a single Markdown concept. Then, you’ll be asked to complete several exercises with that new knowledge

### Learn about DevOps

#### What is DevOps?
DevOps is a collaboration between Development and IT Operations to make software production and deployment in an automated & repeatable way. DevOps helps to increase the organization's speed to deliver software applications and services. The word 'DevOps' is a combination of two words, 'Development' and 'Operations.'

It allows organizations to serve their customers better and compete more strongly in the market. In simple words, DevOps can be defined as an alignment of development and IT operations with better communication and collaboration.

#### Why is DevOps is Needed?
Before DevOps, the development and operation team worked in complete isolation.
Testing and Deployment were isolated activities done after design-build. Hence they consumed more time than actual build cycles.
Without using DevOps, team members are spending a large amount of their time in testing, deploying, and designing instead of building the project.
Manual code deployment leads to human errors in production
Coding & operation teams have their separate timelines and are not in synch causing further delays.
There is a demand to increase the rate of software delivery by business stakeholders. As per Forrester Consulting Study, Only 17% of teams can use delivery software fast enough. This proves the pain point.

#### How is DevOps different from traditional IT
Now in this DevOps training, let's compare traditional software waterfall model with DevOps to understand the changes DevOps bring.

We assume the application is scheduled to go live in 2 weeks and coding is 80% done. We assume the application is a fresh launch and the process of buying servers to ship the code has just begun-

#### Why is DevOps used?
DevOps allows Agile Development Teams to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This helps them to launch products faster into the market.

Other Important reasons are:

1. Predictability: DevOps offers significantly lower failure rate of new releases

2. Reproducibility: Version everything so that earlier version can be restored anytime.

3. Maintainability: Effortless process of recovery in the event of a new release crashing or disabling the current system.

4. Time to market: DevOps reduces the time to market up to 50% through streamlined software delivery. This is particularly the case for digital and mobile applications.

5. Greater Quality: DevOps helps the team to provide improved quality of application development as it incorporates infrastructure issues.

6. Reduced Risk: DevOps incorporates security aspects in the software delivery lifecycle. It helps in reduction of defects across the lifecycle.

7. Resiliency: The Operational state of the software system is more stable, secure, and changes are auditable.

8. Cost Efficiency: DevOps offers cost efficiency in the software development process which is always an aspiration of IT companies' management.

9. Breaks larger code base into small pieces: DevOps is based on the agile programming method. Therefore, it allows breaking larger code bases into smaller and manageable chunks.

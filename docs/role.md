#### Developers and the DevOps Culture

There tends to be intermittent friction between the two aspects of business, since they’re cut out for different roles altogether; 
developers strive for continuous innovation and product enrichment through experimentation and customer feedback, whereas the Ops department oversees up time, 
costing, delivery and business continuity.

1) DevOps is meant to unify the aggregated goal of both players i.e. to deliver the entire project on time while keeping infamous excuses like “it works fine on localhost” and “everything was fine before that change” at bay. Unlike traditional approaches where developers might get away with just handing over the code, the ‘DevOps synergy’ empowers developers to deliver a turnkey solution through coded operations and automation by utilizing tools such as Puppet and the esolang Chef.

2) Since all the elements are programmable on the Cloud, DevOps is able to provide full control and access to developers for writing programs on a platform they own and can manage adeptly. Once the dev team and Ops are on the same page, the results in improved distributed and scalable systems.

3) DevOps and developers go hand in hand when developing enterprise services on the Cloud. On a traditional model these services (be it PaaS or SaaS) offer great productivity and features; however they’re unable to retain core control in the absence of devops, which is crucial for customization. Here’s a comprehensive post by Adrian Cockcroft who talks about DevOps and how it fits in with current dev practices at Netflix: http://perfcap.blogspot.co.il/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html

4) The quintessential characteristics of a SaaS environment are redundancy, scalability, automation, incremental changes, security and performance. This is why many vendors are now considering to embed DevOps from the initial phases of development. Cost is another major factor in service oriented models hence developers have to be smart with resource management in order to maintain topnotch performance e.g.for provisioning new virtual machines (VMs). The other recent development we’ve seen is the growing number of industry stakeholders mentioning DevOps with reference to SaaS best practices.

5) It is also important to highlight that in order to get the most of, and be successful in the DevOps arena, being a good developer will not suffice. Apart from code, developers need to be knowledgeable in Ops, security and architecture.

# DevOps Engineer

A DevOps engineer works with diverse teams and departments to create and implement software systems. People who work in DevOps are experienced IT professionals who collaborate with software developers, quality assurance professionals, and IT staff to manage code releases.

DevOps engineers need to be able to multitask, demonstrate flexibility, and deal with many different situations at a time. Specifically, a DevOps engineer’s responsibilities include:

#### Documentation:
Writes specifications and documentation for the server-side features.

#### Systems analysis: 
Analyzes the technology currently being used and develops plans and processes for improvement and expansion. The DevOps engineer provides support for urgent analytic needs.

#### Development: 
Develops, codes, builds, installs, configures, and maintains IT solutions.

#### Project planning: 
Participates in project planning meetings to share their knowledge of system options, risk, impact, and costs vs. benefits. In addition, DevOps engineers communicate operational requirements and development forecasts.

#### Testing: 
Tests code, processes, and deployments to identify ways to streamline and minimize errors.

#### Deployment: 
Uses configuration management software to automatically deploy updates and fixes into the production environment.

#### Maintenance and troubleshooting: 
Performs routine application maintenance to ensure the production environment runs smoothly. Develops maintenance requirements and procedures.

#### Performance management: 
Recommends performance enhancements by performing gap analysis, identifying alternative solutions, and assisting with modifications.

#### Management: 
Depending on the size of the organization, the DevOps engineer may also be responsible for managing a team of DevOps engineers.

# Quality Engineer

A quality engineering approach is improving software development processes, instead of only changing them just for the sake of it. 
A conglomerate of optimal quality assurance, monitoring, and predictive analytics, Quality Engineering solutions employ futuristic technologies
and are fit for any forward-looking organization. Integrating Quality Engineering with DevOps diminishes the likelihood of defects to negligible
through an ongoing cycle of feedback and improvement until the desired quality is obtained.

#### QA doesn’t cut it anymore

Since the inception of the sci-fi genre, whatever we have seen or read has either become the reality or will become one in the near future. This future is not further than a couple years. Artificial intelligence is penetrating our lives, robots are assisting surgeries, autonomous cars will soon hit the roads. Amidst all these advancements, QA simply is not enough. There is need for something that not only assures quality but engineers it deep into the core of an application, thus, making it as error-proof as possible. Quality assurance is still required, but it needs to be revamped and upgraded to a higher cognition with the assistance from avant-garde tools, skilled people, and optimized processes.

Shifting to the left and to the right

Spanning the entire process of an SDLC from requirement phase till release phase, Quality Engineering yields maximum test coverage for producing best quality end product. By shifting QA to the left, it ensures that the set criteria are effectively incorporated into the product build at the time of development itself. On the other hand, by taking the shift-right approach of testing, Quality Engineering in DevOps works to impart utmost level of user satisfaction through valuable releases. By doing so, software quality engineering leads broad spectrum coverage of the testing life cycle and effectively manages test data and test environment.

#### QE for continuous delivery through continuous integration

A non-siloed software development process in DevOps methodology utilizes automated tools for code building, testing, and deploying. As each change in the code is uploaded in a central repository for faster integration, continuous delivery offers visibility to everyone involved and establishes transparency across the cycle. With change being integrated and effectuated immediately, the provision of faster feedback is activated, creating an endless loop of improvements and deployments. The enhanced visibility and dissolved silos have blurred the lines between testing and developing roles, making everyone responsible for the quality aspect of produced software.

#### Re-engineering Quality Assurance

The IT industry is in a dynamic state right now. Trends such as digital transformation, DevOps, and automation are acting as catalysts that will decide what shape it will take upon reaching equilibrium. This paradigm shift in the base components has generated the demand for an advanced chemical process for successful completion of the reaction. DevOps is turning out to be indispensable for organizations to stay in the game. QE services in DevOps not only keep software companies in the game but also fuel their win by reducing time to market and testing expenses while bettering quality for high customer satisfaction.

#### Quality Engineering powering up DevOps pipeline

While DevOps brings together development and operations teams, Quality Engineering strategy combines management, design, and operations. This holistic approach of QE in DevOps allows organizations to be legally compliant while staying aligned with the set business goals and objectives. It gets aid from IT management, product management, software and systems engineering and systems operations to develop a wholly secure, reliable, and safe application.

#### Automation for a suave future

Automation sits at the heart of a DevOps pipeline. The agility needed by a DevOps methodology is impossible to meet manually. A strategic combination of manual and automation processes is imperative with human professionals mainly involved in the creative and supervisory roles and automated tools taking care of the iterative steps. Quality Engineering in DevOps recruits robotic process automation tools for delegation of time-consuming tasks. Using AI and data analytics, QE services suggest modifications in the existing code and predict potential risks and threats. Quality Engineering is effective in handling threat and security concerns by fool-proofing the built code through focused monitoring, even post deployment.

#### Data mapping and knowledge management

There are heaps of structured as well as unstructured data generated. This data has to be properly managed and utilized to generate optimal test cases and user scenarios for successful test runs. Quality Engineering uses software and system models for scanning such volumes of data to segregate valuable information from illegible, invalid data. Through proper knowledge mapping and knowledge management, QE services help in early recognition and addressal of vulnerabilities. Quality Engineering is also effective in masking sensitive data to generate production-quality test results while protecting private and confidential user information.
